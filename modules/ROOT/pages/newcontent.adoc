= Creating New Content
Rick Elrod
:page-authors: {author}

Content can be broken into several different components, although some of the
process is the same for all cases.

All new sites are being built with the Python link:http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask]
framework and the link:https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/[Frozen-Flask] library
for generating static pages.

== New Editions

New editions of Fedora should be added to the getfedora.org website. We are
trying to get away from having a bunch of `*.fedoraproject.org` sites for each
of the various editions (currently we have link:https://coreos.fedoraproject.org[],
link:https://iot.fedoraproject.org[], etc.).

== New Websites

There are cases, however, where the content being added is *not* a new edition,
and is deserving of having its own distinct website, separate from
getfedora.org. These cases should probably be somewhat rare.
