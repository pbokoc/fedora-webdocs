The Fedora Websites project owns and maintains the Project's online presence.
Among other things, the team:

* Works closely with the
  link:++https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design++[Fedora Design team] to build
  our websites in a way that is visually pleasing, easy to use, accessible to
  everybody, and provides a good experience for newcomers and existing users
  and contributors alike.
* Works closely with the
  link:++https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/L10N++[Fedora Translations team] to
  ensure that websites are able to be translated into different languages.
* Maintains the content of the websites, updating it as necessary for releases,
  new editions, new spins, and so on.
* Typically has one member (either in Design or Websites) who sits on the
  xref:mindshare::index.adoc[Fedora Mindshare committee].
