The Fedora Websites project owns and maintains the Project's online presence.
Among other things, the team:

* Works closely with the Fedora Design team to build out websites in a way that
  is visually pleasing, easy to use, accessible to everybody, and provides a
  good experience for newcomers and existing users and contributors alike.
* Works closely with the Fedora Translations team to ensure that websites are
  able to be translated into different languages.
* Maintains the content of the websites, updating it as necessary for releases,
  new editions, new spins, and so on.
* Typically has one member (either in Design or Websites) who sits on the Fedora
  Mindshare committee.
