= Creating A New Site

In rare cases, you might need to create an entirely new site, rather than an
edition or page on getfedora.org.

In a future world, this document will help you do so.

For this to happen effectively, we'll need to abstract some things out from the
current getfedora.org work.

But familiarizing yourself with link:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/[Flask]
and link:https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/[Frozen-Flask] is a good starting
point, as we plan for all of our websites to build using this toolset.
